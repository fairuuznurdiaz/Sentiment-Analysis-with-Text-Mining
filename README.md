**Developing an Enhanced Recommendation System for Women’s Clothing in E-Commerce: A Comparative Analysis of Traditional Machine Learning and Deep Learning Approaches
**
Customer reviews play an important role in the e-commerce sector. These reviews serve as an important tool for understanding customer sentiment. These reviews provide valuable insights into consumer preferences, experiences, and satisfaction levels, thereby enabling e-commerce businesses to make informed decisions. By analyzing customer feedback, companies can identify trends, improve product offerings, and improve the overall shopping experience [1]. This not only helps build a loyal customer base but also drives business growth and competitiveness in a crowded market. Therefore, leveraging customer reviews is crucial for women’s clothing e-commerce platforms that aim to stay in tune with their customers’ needs and preferences.

However, customer reviews have problems that need to be addressed, such as a variety of different feature types, namely text, categorical, and numeric. A lot of data is missing, such as the text in the review title where the solution must use adjective extraction to get a better meaning [2]. In the feature selection process, there are 10 important features, including: Title, Review Text, Rating, Recommended IND, etc [3]. Selecting the Recommended IND feature as a label is important because it shows whether customers recommend the product, which is a key indicator of customer satisfaction. Using the Rating feature is also very important because it provides direct information regarding customer assessments of products, which helps in analyzing sentiment in review text and title text to decide on business policies.

The problem of data imbalance in customer review datasets requires special handling to ensure that the machine learning model being built is not biased. This imbalance can cause the model to be more likely to predict the majority class, ignoring the minority class which is also important [4]. To balance the dataset, methods such as K-Means or Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) can be used [5]. K-Means can help with clustering and then re-sampling to balance the classes, while SMOTE works by synthesizing new samples from the minority class to increase the number until it is more balanced with the majority class [6]. These two techniques help create a more  balanced dataset, ultimately improving the model’s performance and accuracy in predicting outcomes in both classes.

The recommendation flow starts with a simple Logistic Regression[7] with TF and TF-IDF [8] feature extraction, also the other comparing text representation using GloVe embeddings[9], to ensure fix length on features some approach are use i.e mean, median, max, midpoint, and absolute max pooling. after that the best pooling are combined to TF-IDF to see whether the performance are get better or not. But ML models still fail to capture complex patterns in textual data. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) [10] excel at recognizing local patterns, Recurrent neural networks (RNN) [11] is good for processing sequential data, while Long short term memory [12] is able to handle long- term dependencies in text. The combination of CNN-LSTM with GloVe Embedding provides rich word representation and deep contextual understanding, resulting in highly accurate and reliable predictions.
